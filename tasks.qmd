## Review ggplot Basics

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)

# new packages!
library(patchwork) # piecing together charts
library(ggrepel) # add repulsive labels
library(gghighlight)
library(paletteer)
```

### Read in data

```{r}
lizards <- read_csv(here::here("data_tidy", "lizards.csv"))
```

Create subset:

1.  limit data for western whiptails, colorodo checkered and eastern fence lizards
2.  add new column converted total length to cm
3.  group by species and site
4.  return summary with mean total length and sd of total length by species and site

```{r}
lizard_sub <- lizards %>% 
  filter(common_name %in% c("western whiptail", "colorado checkered", "eastern fence")) %>% 
  mutate(total_length_cm = total_length/10) %>% 
  group_by(common_name, site) %>% 
  summarize(mean_total_length = mean(total_length, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_total_length = sd(total_length, na.rm = TRUE))

```

## Scatterplot

```{r}
ggplot(data = lizards,
       aes(x = total_length,
           y = weight)) +
  geom_point(
    aes(color = common_name)) +
  facet_wrap(~ common_name) + # split charts by common name; scales = FREE would make individual scales for each chart 
  theme_classic()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = lizards,
       aes(x = total_length,
           y = weight)) +
  geom_point(
    aes(color = weight)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100),
                     breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 20),
                     expand = c(0, 0)) + # get rid of the space between data/axis 
  scale_color_gradient(low = "orange",
                       high = "navy")
```

## Bar Chart

```{r}
lizard_counts <- lizards %>% 
  count(common_name)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = lizard_counts,
       aes(x = n,
           y = fct_reorder(common_name, n), # make into a factor, order by n
           fill = common_name)) +
  geom_col()
```
